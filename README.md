There isn't much to say about this project.  I am participatng in a coding bootcamp called Thinkful that will hopefully end
in gainful employment/work.

I have been borking around with computers since I was a kid.  My father first introduced me to a C64 when I was a very small
kid.  Same time, elemetary schools were using Apple IIe computers and I learned how to do simple things like starting
a program or game.  The same with the C64.  My father started me on the path to being a computer user and always asking why and
how something worked.

In the mid 90's I had a 386 computer I used to learn BASIC and I programmed a very simple Zelda clone.  My next step was learning
C++ and I programmed my first application, a Dungeons and Dragons character generator that saw many revisions and use throughout
my time in middle school and evenhigh school.

Then something happend.  I stopped programming.  I still continued to create webpages and sites, but mostly through copy and paste
as CSS became a thing and I had lost the drive to learn that kind of thing.

Now, the sky is the limit.  I am getting back into the groove and will make something of myself.

And to start it all off?  From the beginning.
