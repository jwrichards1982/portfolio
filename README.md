THIS REPO HAS BEN COMPLETELY REWRITTEN and MASTER HAS BEEN REPLACED

I am a software developer and hobbyist coder living in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.

My journey started when I was young; my father showed me how to start games on his Commodore 64.  When I entered middle-school, I learned how to do the same on Apple IIe and even little bits of code to complete math problems.  I built my first computer, a 386 out of my father's spare, hand-me-down parts.  

Since then, I ask the question "...how/why does this work?"
I have contributed and developed a handful of projects, including:

NEW - 21-March-2023 - Working on a Minecraft mod : [HERE](https://github.com/jwrichards1982/mc_wine)
* A Zelda clone developed in BASIC circa 1993, 6th grade middle-school
* A Dungeons and Dragons character generator in C++ circa 1995, continued development till around 1999
* Developed and coded a few websites used in commercial setting
* Contributed and developed several game modifications for Minecraft
